# X Series 2 Webfont for Arabic Script

X Series 2 fonts are designed with web use in mind, so the line spacing is optimized for Arabic script in general use. 
The positionning of vowels and accents on the characters require more line spacing than what is set on these fonts 
to avoid superposing these vowels and accents on characters from the line above or below. Although the chance of such 
cases occuring is minimal, they may happen. Since vowels and accents are not used in general practice, and they are mostly 
used on a word processor, it is recommanded that one manually adjust the line spacing on a word processor 
when the vowels and accent are used extensively.

X Series 2 fonts are built on freely available fonts and extended to 
support Persian, Arabic, Urdu, Pashto, Dari, Uzbek, Kurdish, Uighur, 
old Turkish (Ottoman) and modern Turkish (Roman).

These fonts are equipped with two font technologies, AAT and OpenType and can be used on 
any platform, Mac, Windows or Linux.
